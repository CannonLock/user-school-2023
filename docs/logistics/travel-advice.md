# Travel Advice

This page offers some tips for traveling to and from the OSG User School.

Even in the best of times, there is always the chance for travel issues —
due to weather, mechanical issues, and so on.
Lately, it seems that flight cancellations are even more common, 
so it is good to be prepared for last-minute changes.
Below are some tips and ideas for dealing with travel.

For concerns about COVID, before or during the event, please see our [COVID page](../covid-policy.md).

## Checking In Early

Airlines generally allow you to check in for your flights the day before.
Doing so may save you time and hassle at the airport on the day of travel.
Go to your airline website and look for the “Check In” section, then follow the steps.

## Finding Flight Status

Be sure to check your flight status often, starting the day before travel begins.
While you can check the status of each flight individually on the airline website (or a third-party site),
you may be able to view your entire trip at once. 

Go to your airline website, find their section for “My Trips” or something similar,
and use the six-character “Confirmation Number” on your itinerary 
plus your last name to access your full itinerary,
including flight status for each segment.

Definitely check your flight status before leaving for the airport!

## Handling Flight Changes

If the airlines make changes to your flights, see if you will still arrive at the School on time. 
Ideally, you arrive in Madison before about 6 p.m. on Sunday, July 24.
If changes push your arrival later on Sunday, that is fine, just do your best to get here.

If flight changes cause you to arrive later than Sunday, **please let us know as soon as you can**.

## Handling Flight Cancellations

If one or more flights are cancelled, you will need to make new plans with the airlines.

If Travel Incorporated made your travel arrangements, they can help in case of problems.
Their contact information should have been on your itinerary confirmation,
and we suggest saving it on your phone ahead of time.

**Travel Incorporated phone numbers**

*   Within the U.S.: +1 (877) 811-9898
*   Outside the U.S.: +1 (470) 589-2205

It may help to have our admin group code (UWMSN060222) handy, but this is not required.

**Note:** If you call Travel Incorporated outside of their normal hours
(7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Central Time weekdays),
they will route your call to their after-hours service and
charge us an extra $18 just to talk to a person.
So while we want you to get the help you need,
please consider other options (like your airline), too.

If you are at an airport, it is a good idea to get in line at your airline’s
service counter; you can call the airline or Travel Inc. while waiting in line.

Once you have contacted the airline or Travel Incorporated about any concerns and when you have time,
please [email us](mailto:user-school@opensciencegrid.org) with any news especially if it changes your arrival day or time.
