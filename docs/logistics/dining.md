# Dining

There are many dining options in Madison near the user school, especially on State Street which is only a couple 
of blocks away. We have curated a staff list of options below but, it is not exhaustive, so we encourage you to look 
online as well if these don't suite your taste. 

## Local Food Trucks

There are many food trucks that set up around [Library Mall](https://goo.gl/maps/XyDkbBEb6ffHByYq5) 2 blocks from the school. 
If you would like to see what trucks/carts are available before going over you can use the website below.
