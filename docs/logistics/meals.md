# Meals and Food During the School

## Meals Overview

The following meals will be provided by the School as group, catered meals:

- Monday through  Wednesday - August 7 - 9:

    Breakfast and Lunch

- Friday, August 11:

    Lunch and Dinner
There is [another page](dining.md) with suggestions for finding dining options near the School and hotel.


During the School week the following meals will be on your own. (See the [School Meals section](#meal-reimbursement-tips) below for the reimbursement details).

- Dinners Sunday through Thursday will be on your own
- On Thursday, August 10, breakfast, lunch (and dinner) will be on your own
- On Friday, August 11, breakfast will be on your own

Of  course, we hope you join your classmates for many of these “on your own” meals.

Please check this [informational page](./dining.md) with ideas on eating in Madison near the School or hotel.

## School Meals

The School pays for your meals during the School.

As  we noted, we provide the following meals directly for everyone:

- Breakfasts on Monday through Wednesday
- Lunches on Monday through Wednesday and Friday
- Our Closing Dinner on Friday, August 11 held at Union South.

The breakfasts and lunches will be served in the Education Building, Room L117 near the lecture hall for the School. There is nearby seating both inside and out for these meals.

For dinners Sunday through Thursday and the two breakfasts and one lunch on your own, **if you are not a UW–Madison member**, we can reimburse you after the School. In that case:

- Keep receipts for your meals – if anything so that you remember how much meals cost!
- We can reimburse up to $20 for breakfast, $21 for lunch and $35 for dinner,  including tax and tip.
- If it is not on the receipt, be sure to write the tip amount yourself, so you do not forget.
- We cannot pay for any alcohol, but non-alcoholic drinks are OK — please pay for any alcohol on a separate bill.
- We will explain the reimbursement process after the School.

Again, if you are a member of the UW–Madison community, by University rules we cannot pay for your meals other than the group, catered ones.

## Meal Reimbursement Tips

Again, if you are **not** part of the UW&ndash;Madison community,
we can reimburse you for dinners Sunday through Wednesday,
all meals on Thursday,
and breakfast on Friday. We have curated a page of some possible [dining options](./dining.md) to use as inspiration.

Some tips for successful reimbursements:

*   Keep receipts for your meals – if anything so that you remember how much meals cost!

*   We can reimburse up to $20 for breakfast, $21 for lunch and $35 for dinner, including tax and tip.
    For dumb reasons, we can reimburse only $32 for Sunday dinner.

*   If it is not on the receipt, be sure to write the tip amount yourself, so you do not forget.

*   We cannot pay for any alcohol, although non-alcoholic drinks are OK&nbsp;&mdash;
    ideally, pay for alcohol separately.

We will explain the reimbursement process in detail after the School, but the tips above will help.
