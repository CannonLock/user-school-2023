# Meal Information

The School includes some group catered meals for all participants:

*   Tuesday (Aug. 8) &mdash; breakfast and lunch
*   Wednesday (Aug. 9) &mdash; breakfast and lunch
*   Thursday (Aug. 10) &mdash; *none*
*   Friday (Aug. 11) &mdash; lunch and (closing) dinner

Other meals not listed above are on your own.

If you are **not** a member of the UW&ndash;Madison community,
we will reimburse you for the on-your-own meals,
Sunday dinner through Friday breakfast;
see below for details.
Sorry, UW&ndash;Madison folks: The rules say that we cannot reimburse you for meals here.

For the meals on your own, you are welcome to join other participants and even staff!
We can help with ideas and groups, if you like.
There is [another page](dining.md) with suggestions for finding dining options near the School and hotel.

## Catered Meals

The catered breakfasts and lunches during the School (see above)
will be served in the Education Building,
Room L177, near upper doors of the lecture hall (L196).
There is seating nearby both inside and outside.

## Meal Reimbursement Tips

Again, if you are **not** part of the UW&ndash;Madison community,
we can reimburse you for dinners Sunday through Wednesday,
all meals on Thursday,
and breakfast on Friday. We have curated a page of some possible [dining options](./dining.md) to use as inspiration.

Some tips for successful reimbursements:

*   Keep receipts for your meals â€“ if anything so that you remember how much meals cost!

*   We can reimburse up to $20 for breakfast, $21 for lunch and $35 for dinner, including tax and tip.
    For dumb reasons, we can reimburse only $32 for Sunday dinner.

*   If it is not on the receipt, be sure to write the tip amount yourself, so you do not forget.

*   We cannot pay for any alcohol, although non-alcoholic drinks are OK&nbsp;&mdash;
    ideally, pay for alcohol separately.

We will explain the reimbursement process in detail after the School, but the tips above will help.
