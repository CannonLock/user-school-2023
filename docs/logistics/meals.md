# Meals and Food During the School

All catered, group meals that the School provides will include vegan and vegetarian options.  If you indicated other
dietary needs in the survey, we will address those on a case-by-case basis as well.

## School Meals

The School pays for your meals during the School.

First, we provide the following meals directly:

-   Breakfasts on Monday through Friday — held in Computer Sciences Room 1240, the same room as the school sessions
-   Lunches on Monday through Friday — held near the lecture hall
-   Generally, there will be coffee and packets for tea

For dinners Sunday through Thursday, **if you are not a UW&ndash;Madison member**,
we can reimburse you after the School.
In that case:

-   Keep receipts for your dinners &ndash; if anything so that you remember how much meals cost!
-   We can reimburse **up to** $30.00, including tax and tip
-   If it is not on the receipt, be sure to write the tip amount yourself, so you do not forget
-   We cannot pay for any alcohol, but non-alcoholic drinks are OK — please pay for any alcohol on a separate bill
-   We will explain the reimbursement process after the School

Again, if you are a member of the UW&ndash;Madison community,
by University rules we cannot pay for your meals other than the group, catered ones.

## Menus

Below are the menus for the School-provided meals.  Not all options for meeting dietary needs are listed, because the
