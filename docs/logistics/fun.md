# Fun Things to Do in Madison

Summer is a great time to be in Madison.
Below are just a few suggestions of things to do or look into while you are here.

-   [Memorial Union](https://union.wisc.edu/visit/memorial-union/) is a great place to hang out
    and a reasonable walk from the School hotel.
    Many people like to get a drink and relax on
    [the Terrace](https://union.wisc.edu/visit/terrace-at-the-memorial-union/),
    which looks out over Lake Mendota.

    for more information.
