## General Information About the School Schedule

### Travel Schedule

For planning your trip:

-   **Arrive on Sunday, July 24, 2023,** prior to 6 p.m. (if possible).
    There is a welcome dinner on Sunday evening for all participants (including instructors),
    and then classes begin on Monday morning.
    This is a nice way to get to know each other and to start the week.

-   **Depart on Saturday, July 30, 2023,** any time.
    The School ends with another dinner on Friday evening,
    so it is best to stay that night.

If we offered to pay for your hotel room, we will pay for the six nights of this schedule.

### School Hours

The School is generally Monday through Friday, 9:00 a.m. to about 5:00 p.m.;
the lecture hall doors open at about 8:00 a.m. for breakfast,
and there will be optional work sessions on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday evenings.
A detailed schedule will be available before the School begins.
