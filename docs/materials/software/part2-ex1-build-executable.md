Software Exercise 2.1 Build an HTC-Friendly Executable
============================================================

**Objective**: Modify an existing script to include arguments and headers. 

**Why learn this?**: A little bit of preparation can make it easier to reuse the 
same script over and over to run many jobs. 

Arguments
----------



Header
----------

	!!! note 
		The "header" of `#!/bin/bash` will tell the computer that this is a bash shell script and can be run in the same way that  you would run individual commands on the command line.
