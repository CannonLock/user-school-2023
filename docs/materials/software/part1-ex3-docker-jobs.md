Software Exercise 1.3: Use Docker Containers in OSPool Jobs
====================================

**Objective**: Submit a job that uses an existing Docker container. 

**Why learn this?**: Same as the previous exercise; this may also be how you end up 
submitting your jobs if you can find an existing Docker container with your software.  

Submit File and Executable
-------------------

1.  Make a copy of your submit file from the [previous container exercise](../part1-ex2-apptainer-jobs) or build from an existing submit file. 

1.  Add the following lines to the submit file or modify existing lines to match the lines below: 

		:::file
		universe = container
		container_image = docker://python:3.10

	Here we are requesting HTCondor's Docker universe and using a pre-built python image that, by default, will be pulled from a public website of Docker images called DockerHub.  

1.  Use the same executable as the [previous exercise](../part1-ex2-apptainer-jobs). 

1. Once these steps are done, submit the job.

Finding Docker Containers
-------------

There are a lot of Docker containers on Docker Hub, but they are not all 
created equal. Anyone can create an account on Docker Hub and share container images there, so itâ€™s important to exercise caution when choosing a container image on Docker Hub. These are some indicators that a container image on Docker Hub is consistently maintained, functional and secure:

- The container image is updated regularly.
- The container image is associated with a well established company, community, or other group that is well-known.
- There is a Dockerfile or other listing of what has been installed to the container image.
- The container image page has documentation on how to use the container image. [^1]

1. Can you find a container on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) that would be 
useful for running Jupyter notebooks that use tensorflow? 

1. Does your chosen image meet at least 2 of the criteria above?
